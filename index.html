I made some stuff today because I was bored. <br><br>

<a href="rgb-clock">RGB Clock</a> - The background color changes according to the time of day. R = hours, G = minutes, B = seconds. <br>
<a href="ohno">Ohno</a> - The page flashes "OH NO" and redirects to Google News. <br>
<a href="cry">Cry</a> - The page does nothing for a full hour and then begins crying.<br>
